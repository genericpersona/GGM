Intro to gilbertgrapesmom
-------------------------

gilbertgrapesmom is a Twisted-based Python 2.7+ 
IRC bot.

It is composed of plugins, which add functionality
to the bot. The bot looks for the presence of
commands or other triggers for action in the 
messages that it sees, i.e., either channel or 
private. If one is found, then the bot replies
accordingly.

It requires the following third party libraries:

  twisted         (for the asynch event-driven IRC awareness)

Plugins require their own libraries, which are specified in the
plugins directory's README.
