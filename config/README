gilbertgrapesmom Config Files
-----------------------------

A Python formatted config file is essential to the plugin based nature of
gilbertgrape's mom.  When the bot first runs it parses the config file to get
basic information about IRC login credentials and servers along with all the 
plugins that the bot will use.

The sections of the config file are as follows:

main
-----
  - The only required section
  - Has the most basic information

<name of plugin>
-----------------
  - Each plugin should have its own config section
  - The current required directives are:
    -- module (name of module to import to find the plugin)
    -- callback (name of method used to parse commands for the bot)

An example config file is found in ggm.conf.clean.
